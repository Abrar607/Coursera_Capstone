This website contains datasets with information about each city in Canada such as demographic and socioeconomic information of the population divided based on neighborhoods and boroughs facilitating its use. The citations will be listed for both datasets in a future section. Maps will be used to best visualize patterns and create models. \n\n**To understand the data more**, I will explore the different variants affecting the success of a movie theater in a city and specify for Toronto in particular. This will be by looking at the similarities between the existing cinemas and looking at population as well as income to determine their effect on location determination for the new movie theater. \n\n**For example**, the census comprises of incomes based on neighborhoods that can be matched to Foursquare data mapping the existence or the presence of a movie theater and the frequency. By looking at other areas, the prediction for the new location will be more accurate not only in terms of location but also in terms of success in that region with regards to demographic and socioeconomic factors."
